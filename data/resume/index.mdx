## Work Experience

### May 2023 - Present, <a href="https://kissflow.com" target="_blank">Kissflow</a> - Software Engineer

Kissflow is an intuitive no-code/low-code platform that lets business users create complex
internal apps and external portals by dragging and dropping prebuilt UI elements and
configuring them.

#### Low-Code No-Code SDK and Custom Form Fields

'Kissflow Forms' have a carefully curated set of built-in form fields that can be used to
create most dynamic forms. However, if the builtin form fields don’t fulfill users' needs,
they can develop their own form fields (Custom Form Fields) using
<a href="https://github.com/kissflow/lcnc-sdk-js" target="_blank">kf-lcnc-sdk</a>. I made major changes to the
no-code/low-code platform (both Web and PWA) to accommodate custom form fields: a
'Pro-code' functionality.

##### Build tool

- Built a CLI application using Node.js and <a href="https://ejs.co" target="_blank">EJS</a> which lets users create projects (Kissflow
  custom components) that have Webpack, ESLint, HTTP server (Dev server), forward proxy,
  Prettier, etc. configurated to seamlessly work with Kissflow, so that the users can
  focus on developing the business logic of the custom component instead of worrying about
  setting up a project.

- Setup CD using Github Actions to automatically release patch versions of packages to npm
  registry when a pull request is merged to the master branch.

- The users can run the project (dev build) on their machine and preview how the modules
  exported by the project will look and behave across the platform in different scenarios,
  allowing them to iterate rapidly. The browser prevented loading of assets served by the
  dev server into the platform (webapp) due to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP" target="_blank">Content Security Policy</a>.
  I configured a forward proxy in the dev server that allows the browser to load the entire platform through it. Now that the
  platform and the local files are loaded from the same origin, the Content Security
  Policy is bypassed.

##### Dynamic Loader and API

- Built a Dynamic Loader using Webpack's <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation" target="_blank">Module Federation</a> to load modules exported by
  Custom Form Fields (<a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/#dynamic-remote-containers" target="_blank">Dynamic Remotes</a>) into the platform during runtime.

- Designed and implemented a simple and intuitive React props-based API using which the
  modules of custom form fields interact with the platform.

#### Developer Experience

- Implemented live reloading using websocket and HtmlWebpackPlugin.

- Made multiple tweeks to Jenkins.

### Mar 2022 - May 2023, <a href="https://facilio.com" target="_blank">Facilio</a> - Member of Technical Staff

- Rewrote/refactored multiple critical legacy features to increase their efficiency and
  dependability while adhering to modern software engineering best practices.

- Separated authentication related components and move it to a separate repository, so
  that the authentication services can be deployed independently.

### Jun 2021 - Mar 2022, <a href="https://www.fintuple.com" target="_blank">Fintuple Technolgies</a> - Product Engineer

- Making improvements to Angular projects by fixing errors, improving performance and
  adding new features.

- Implemented CI/CD for multiple Angular projects using Github Actions.

- Built a web scraper to scrape price data from Bombay/National Stock Exchange’s official websites.

- Built a REST API to extract structured text data from images of Indian OVDs (Officially
  Valid Documents) such as Aadhaar card, driving license, PAN card, etc. using Amazon
  Textract and AWS Lambda.
