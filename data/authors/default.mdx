I’m a full-stack software engineer with **{Math.round(careerDuration.years +
careerDuration.months / 12 )} years** of experience, currently working at
{<a href="https://kissflow.com" target="_blank">Kissflow</a>}. I’ve worked
across multiple teams and companies, taking on a wide range of responsibilities
— from backend and frontend development to database admin, cloud infrastructure,
and DevOps. I’m comfortable wearing multiple hats and picking up whatever tools
or skills the problem calls for. These days, I’m focused on backend engineering,
infrastructure, developer tools, build systems, CI/CD, application security,
containers, and distributed systems — anything that makes systems more reliable
and dev workflows smoother.
