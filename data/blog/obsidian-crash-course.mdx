## Wikilinks vs. Markdown links

`[[ ]]` are called **Wikilinks**, while `[]()` are called **Markdown links**.

## Why use Markdown links over Wikilinks?

- I prefer markdown links because they are used in Github flavoured markdown &
  MDX. So the links present in my notes will work in Obsidian, Github & my
  personal blog (uses MDX) without modification.

- Can be used with URLs as well. For example,`[Google](https://www.google.com)`.

## Make Obsidian use Markdown links

Obsidian uses Wikilinks out of the box but can be configured to use markdown
links.

![Enable markdown links in Obsidian](/static/images/blogs/obsidian-crash-course/enable-markdown-links.png)

Even if Obsidian is configured to use markdown links, typing `[[]]` will only
trigger suggestions, ones a suggestion is selected Obsidian will automatically
convert it into a markdown link. This is counter-intuitive because typing `[]()`
doesn't trigger suggestions (but typing `[[]]` does) even if Obsidian is
configured to use markdown links.

## Crash course

### Links

#### Add a link to a note

- **Wikilinks**: `[[some-file|Link text]]`

- **Markdown links**: `[Link text](some-file.md)`

#### Add a link to a section of a note

Typing `[[]]` will trigger suggestions, focus on a suggested note and type `#`,
Obsidian will then suggest sections from the selected note, you can then focus
on the required section and press `Enter`, Obsidian will create a link to the
section of the note, clicking on this link will take you directly to the section
of the note.

- **Wikilinks**: `[[some-file#section|Link text]]`

- **Markdown links**: `[Link text](some-file.md#section)`

#### Add a link to an image,

- **Wikilinks**: `[[some-image-file.png|My picture]]`

- **Markdown links**: `[My picture](some-image-file.png)`

Note: This adds a clickable link that opens the image in an Obsidian tab.

### Embed

#### To embed an image in a note,

- **Wikilinks**: `![[Test.png]]`

- **Markdown links**: `![Alt text](Test.png)`

The preview of the image is only shown in Obsidian or markdown previewers not in
text editors or web browsers (refer
[Always edit/read your notes using Obsidian](#Always%20edit/read%20your%20notes%20using%20Obsidian.)).

#### You can also embed a note inside another note (not recommended),

- **Wikilinks**: `![[path of the note]]`

- **Markdown links**: `![](path of the note)`

Note: You can also embed Youtube videos using the syntax used above. It is fun
to take notes while watching Youtube videos inside Obsidian itself without
creating a split screen or switching between Obsidian and Google Chrome
frequently!

## Always edit/read your notes using Obsidian

To put it simply Obsidian is a text editor & markdown previewer...

Obisidian uses markdown files and they can be edited using

Markdown has some quirks, for example, line breaks doesn't create new
paragraphs!

```md
Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2
```

Won't be converted to,

```html
<p>Paragraph 1</p>

<p>Paragraph 2</p>
```

It will be converted to,

```html
<p>Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2</p>
```

Use two spaces or a backslash (`\`) at the end of the line,

```markdown
Para1 para2
```

Or

```markdown
Para1\
para2
```

Converts to

```html
<p>Para1 <br />Para2</p>
```

Markdown was designed to both look clean and natural in

Avoid using code editors to read/edit notes as much as possible, because you
won't be able to preview the text alignment (refer
[Use single line per 'task' & 'bullet point'](#Use%20single%20line%20per%20'task'%20&%20'bullet%20point')),
images, youtube videos, Excalidraw drawings, embedded notes, etc. Use code
editors to only work with Git.

## Don't use code formatters

Don't use code formatters like 'Prettier' to format .md files present in
Obsidian vaults. There is nothing wrong with code formatters, they do their job
well but in some cases Obsidian can't render formatted text property (refer
[Use single line per 'task' & 'bullet point'](#Use%20single%20line%20per%20'task')
). Manually format your files as you write them.

## Use single line per 'task' & 'bullet point'

Use single line per 'task' & 'bullet point', lengthy tasks & bullet points might
look pretty & readable in code editors if written in multiple lines but Obsidian
doesn't render them with proper indents.
