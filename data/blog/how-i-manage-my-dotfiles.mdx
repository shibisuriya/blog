I will be explaining my dotfiles setup in this blog post, if you are someone who
doesn't know what dotfiles are, why would you want to manage them?, etc. read my
[simple tutorial on managing dotfiles](/blog/how-to-manage-dotfiles).

I own two computers, a PC that has Ubuntu and Windows 11 installed (dual boot)
and a M1 Macbook pro that I use for office work. I am a software engineer by
profession, my work mostly revolves around backend systems, databases,
infrastructure, virtual machine, Docker containers, etc. I prefer Ubuntu or
macOS for software development & only boot into windows for play computer games,
I haven't ported my dotfiles to windows for this reason. My dotfiles work fine
in Ubuntu & macOS.

This blog post also serves as a README for my publically maintained
[dotfiles repo](https://github.com/shibisuriya/.dotfiles), this is intentional
because it forces me to keep this blog post neat & updated so that I can
reference it while setting up a new computer.

# macOS

1. I install [nix (the package manager) for macOS](https://nixos.org/download/),
   I do a multi user installation.

2. I clone my dotfiles repo,

```bash
nix-shell -p git --run "git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/shibisuriya/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles"
```

3. I Install `nix-darwin`

```bash
nix run nix-darwin --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' -- switch --flake ~/.dotfiles/nix-darwin#shibi
```

Note: `nix-darwin` in the above command refers to a flake input.

Ones run, I will have access to the `darwin-rebuild` command.

```bash
darwin-rebuild switch --flake ~/.dotfiles/nix-darwin#shibi
```

4. Install 'Apple Command Line Tools (CLT)'

Neovim Mason uses Apple CLT to build some language servers that I use from
source code.

```bash
xcode-select install
```

CLT is a subset of Xcode, the command above will not install complete Xcode.

Note: This step can't be automated using nix and must be performed manually.

5. Install TPM - Tmux Package Manager,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

Note: This step can be automated using nix but I haven't automated it yet.

6. Symlink the dotfiles to their target locations using GNU Stow,

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
./stow.zsh # A shell script, uses GNU Stow under the hood.
```

7. Update the `.gitconfig` file (this step needs to be automated, I am
   performing this step manually for now because I don't want to store my email,
   full name, etc. in the .gitconfig file publically).

8. I manually install non-free software like Chrome, Obsidian, Docker desktop,
   etc. I maintain a list of [non-free software](#non-free-software-i-need) that
   I need in this blog post so that I can refer it while setting up a new
   computer.

9. I install [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) (I use it to install some programs).

## Formatting .nix files

Code formatters to format .nix files such as 'alejandra', 'nixfmt', etc. for
Neovim are not supported in Apple Silicon, use the `nix fmt` command instead,

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles/nix-darwin
nix fmt
```

# Testing & improving the installation process

Testing & improving the installation process of the dotfiles on the host itself
is not a good idea!

1. Dotfiles might have already been installed on the host.

1. The host will be left in an undesirable state (partially installed
   applications, dotfiles that are not symlinked yet, etc.) if the installation
   process fails for some reason.

I prefer to test the installation process inside a Docker container or virtual
machine (preferably "fresh installs"), I can experiment carelessly without
worrying about my host getting wrecked if something goes wrong.

## macOS (using UTM)

1. Download and install [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/), a super simple app for
   creating and managing virtual machines on macOS; it is a wrapper around
   [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/).

1. Create a macOS VM in UTM & set it up (create users, select time zone,
   language, keyboard layout, etc.). Do not use this VM, instead create a clone
   of this VM for testing & improving the installation process. If something
   fails, delete the clone VM & create another clone... This way you can start
   testing the installation process as soon as the VM boots up instead of
   creating users, selecting time zones, etc. again & again.

1. Execute these [steps](#macos) inside the VM.

1. Fix if something fails & repeat the steps inside a new VM.

## Ubuntu (using Docker container)

I build a Ubuntu based docker image to verify if my dotfiles install flawlessly,
if the docker build fails for some reason then my dotfiles have issues, I can
immediately correct them and rebuild without worrying about my host computer
getting put into incomplete states. This allows me to test and iterate faster, I
don't want a computer with 'fresh install' which take some time to provision!

You can build a Ubuntu based docker image which has most of the programs you
need preinstalled and configured using your dotfiles.

To build the docker image,

```bash
docker build --target prod -t dotfiles .
```

You can then create a container using this image and copy or volume mount
directories/files from your host. This is extremely useful for
tinkering/testing/learning new things without worrying about random programs
modifying your host’s settings.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v .:/root/directory_1 dotfiles
```

Currently I am using ansible playbook to install and configure the programs that
I need in the Docker container... I am planning to replace ansible with nix...
In any cases, you might want to debug/change the build process...

To create a Ubuntu based docker image that has Ansible and Nix preinstalled,

```bash
docker build --target dev -t dotfiles:dev .
```

Spin up a container based on this image and volume mount/copy your dotfiles into
it.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v .:/root/.dotfiles dotfiles:dev
```

Run the ansible playbook,

```bash
ansible-playbook /root/.dotfiles/local.yml
```

# Non-free software I need

- Chrome
- Obsidian
- Docker desktop

# Eternal learner/explorer

The way I manage my dotfiles currently might not be perfect... I am aware that
the tools and techniques that I currently use are not the absolute best, and
there are better alternatives. My current setup works for me, even if it is
imperfect. I am an eternal learner, I will try hard to keep this blog post
updated or rewrite it if required as I explore and adopt new tools and
techniques since this blog post also serves as a README for my publically
maintained [dotfiles](https://github.com/shibisuriya/.dotfiles) repository and
as a personal reference. Feel free to
[share suggestions](https://github.com/shibisuriya/.dotfiles/issues), or let
[me](https://linkedin.com/in/shibisuriya) know if you’d want me to try
something. Thanks for reading my blog post.
