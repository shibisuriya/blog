Now that you know
[what dotfiles are](/blog/how-to-manage-dotfiles#what-are-dotfiles),
[the benefits you can experience by managing them](/blog/how-to-manage-dotfiles#why-should-i-care-about-dotfiles)
&
[how to manage them by moving them into a git repository & manually creating symlinks for them using the `ln` command](/blog/how-to-manage-dotfiles#tutorial),
we will be improving our existing setup from tutorial 1 using
[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) - a neat tool that automates the
process of creating & removing symlinks.

# Existing setup

We have created a git repo at `~/Desktop/dotfiles` using the `git init` command
& moved all of our dotfiles into it. We are then symlinking each dotfile to its
original location using the `ln` command. For example, the bash shell looks for
`.bashrc` (bash's configuration file) at `~` (user's home directory -
`/user/<username>`).

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/dotfiles
ln -s .bashrc ~/ # Use this command for your other dotfiles as well.
```

Since we have multiple dotfiles in our git repository, typing & executing the
`ln` command for each dotfile is annoying! So we have written the `ln` commands
to symlink all the dotfiles to their original location in a shell script -
`symlink.zsh`.

To symlink all of your dotfiles to their original location,

```bash
./symlink.zsh
```

We will be replacing
[`symlink.zsh`](/blog/how-to-manage-dotfiles#ehh-what-are-symlinks) (a shell
script that symlinks each dotfile to its original location) with GNU Stow in
this tutorial.

# Tutorial

Assuming your dotfiles repo is located at `~/Desktop/dotfiles`,

1. Remove `symlink.zsh`,

   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/dotfiles
   rm symlink.zsh
   ```

1. Install GNU Stow,

   - On macOS, using Homebrew,

     ```sh
     brew install stow
     ```

   - On Debian/Ubuntu based distros, using apt,

     ```sh
     sudo apt install stow
     ```

   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/dotfiles
   ls -a
   ```

   Will print,

   ```bash
   .  ..  .bashrc  keybindings.json
   ```

   The default `target` directory is parent of the current directory.

   There are two ways to solve this problem,

   1. Move your dotfiles repo to your home directory (`~`).
