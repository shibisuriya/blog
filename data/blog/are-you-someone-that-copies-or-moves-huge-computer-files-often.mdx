Are you someone that copies or moves huge computer files often? For example, you
could be a photographer who moves the captured photos & videos from your camera
to your computer to free up some space on your camera, you could be a devops or
cloud engineer who moves media files, pdf files, machine learning models, etc.
from one storage service to another to save cost, you could be a sys. admin who
backups an employee's computer before factory resetting it, etc. The point is
moving or copying huge computer files is a day to day responsiblity of a typical
"ops" person.

The annoying part about copying/moving huge computer files is the operation
could be easily interrupted. Imagine you are moving 1 TB of photographs & videos
from your digital camera to your computer by connecting them using a cable, the
operation takes some time to complete & it could fail due to multiple reasons,
the cable could be disturbed, your computer could shutdown due to a power
outage, etc.
