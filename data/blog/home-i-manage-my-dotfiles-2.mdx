If you are new to managing dotfiles, treat this blog post as a highlevel
overview of all the mordern tools & technics that are available.

## Note

This blog post is work in progress, I have made it public because it also serves
as the README.md file for my
[.dotfiles](https://github.com/shibisuriya/.dotfiles) repo.

# A note to myself

This is a public repo, make sure to not commit and push sensitive information to
it. Make sure to clean up the commit history if you accidentally pushed
sensitive information to the remote.

## Setups

As mentioned earlier, this blog also serves as a README.md file for my dotfiles
repo, I use the instructions written below when setting up a new computer. Skip
the steps that are irrelavant for your setup.

### macOS

1. [Install nix for macOS](https://nixos.org/download/), do a multi user
   installation.

2. Clone the dotfiles repo,

```bash
nix-shell -p git --run "git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/shibisuriya/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles"
```

3. Install nix-darwin

```bash
nix run nix-darwin --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' -- switch --flake ~/.dotfiles/nix-darwin#shibi
```

Note: `nix-darwin` in the above command refers to a flake input.

Ones run, we will have access to the `darwin-rebuild` command.

```bash
darwin-rebuild switch --flake ~/.dotfiles/nix-darwin#shibi
```

4. Install 'Apple Command Line Tools (CLT)'

Neovim Mason uses Apple CLT to build some language servers that I use from
source code.

You can skip this step if your setup doesn't depend on CLT.

```bash
xcode-select install
```

CLT is a subset of Xcode, the command above will not install complete Xcode.

Note: This step can't be automated using nix and must be performed manually.

5. Install TPM - Tmux Package Manager,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

Note: This step can be automated using nix.

6. Symlink the dotfiles to their target locations using GNU Stow,

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
./stow.zsh # A shell script, uses GNU Stow under the hood.
```

Instead of using GNU stow to symlink the dotfiles to their target locations we
can use ['nix home-manager'](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager),

My setup is weird! I use nix to manage my computer's system settings and
software packages, git to version control my dotfiles and GNU stow to symlink
them their target locations.

I understand that 'nix home manager' can handle this more gracefully, but for
now I am satisfied with Stow.

7. Update the `.gitconfig` file (this step needs to be automated, I am
   performing this step manually for now because I don't want to store my email,
   full name, etc. in the .gitconfig file publically).

8. Manually install non-free software like Chrome, Obsidian, etc.

## Don't stray away from the defaults (advice)

## Testing my setups

For testing/iterating purposes I don't install my dotfiles on my host computer.
The obivious reason for this is, I already have my dotfiles installed on my
host, I don't want to reinstall it - I want a computer with 'fresh install'!
Also I don't want to put my host into an incomplete state with partially
installed applications, unnecessary files & directories created, etc. (if the
installation process fails for some reason, happens often while making changes
to the dotfiles), obiviously nix allows me to prevent this, nix builds are
'atomic' either they succeeds completely or nothing changes but I prefer to test
my dotfiles files in an isolated environment, either on a computer having a
'fresh install' or in virtual environments.

### Using Docker

I build a Ubuntu based docker image to verify if my dotfiles install flawlessly,
if the docker build fails for some reason then my dotfiles have issues, I can
immediately correct them and rebuild without worrying about my host computer
getting put into incomplete states. This allows me to test and iterate faster, I
don't want a computer with 'fresh install' which take some time to provision!

You can build a Ubuntu based docker image which has most of the programs you
need preinstalled and configured using your dotfiles.

To build the docker image,

```bash
docker build --target prod -t dotfiles .
```

You can then create a container using this image and copy or volume mount
directories/files from your host. This is extremely useful for
tinkering/testing/learning new things without worrying about random programs
modifying your hostâ€™s settings.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v .:/root/directory_1 dotfiles
```

Currently I am using ansible playbook to install and configure the programs that
I need in the Docker container... I am planning to replace ansible with nix...
In any cases, you might want to debug/change the build process...

To create a Ubuntu based docker image that has Ansible and Nix preinstalled,

```bash
docker build --target dev -t dotfiles:dev .
```

Spin up a container based on this image and volume mount/copy your dotfiles into
it.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v .:/root/.dotfiles dotfiles:dev
```

Run the ansible playbook,

```bash
ansible-playbook /root/.dotfiles/local.yml
```

## Formatting .nix files

Code formatters to format .nix files such as 'alejandra', 'nixfmt', etc. for
Neovim are not supported in Apple Silicon.

.nix files can be formatted using the 'nix fmt' command,

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles/nix-darwin
nix fmt
```
