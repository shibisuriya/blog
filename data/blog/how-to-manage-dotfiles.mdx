# Dotfiles repo

Create a directory (name it `.dotfiles`) and move all of your dotfiles into it.

For example, let's move vscode's settings into it,

```bash
mv "~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json" ~/.dotfiles/vscode/settings.json # macOS
```

Initialize a git repo in the directory.

```bash
git init
```

We will symlink the `settings.json` back to
`~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/` using a neat tool named GNU stow.

# Warning

If you have decided to maintain your dotfiles publically make sure to not commit
and push sensitive information (could include, personal email addresses, JWT
tokens, passwords, etc.) to the remote! If you have pushed sensitive information
to the remote accidentally, make sure to clean up the commit history.

# Don't stray away from the defaults (advice)

Only use a handful of tools, also we must develop the habit of using a software
product the way the developer of the product intended it to be used & not
customize it too much, memorize the default keybindings (only the essential ones
not all), study the default behaviours and do not try to make things look
"pretty" (rabbit hole that has no end)! Do not waste time

Keep things dead simple.
