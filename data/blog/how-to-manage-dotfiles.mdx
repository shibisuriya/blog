# What are dotfiles?

Dotfiles are hidden files that are used to configure the behaviour of programs
in Unix-based operating systems like GNU/Linux or macOS. For example, the
dotfile `.zshrc` (typically present in the user's home directory -
`/Users/<username>/`) can be used to configure the user's zsh shell.

# The problem with dotfiles

## Owning multiple computers

Let's say, recently at work your task involves frequently making small changes
to the codebase and then pushing them to the remote (think testing a CI by trail
& error). After scambling through the clunky GUI of vscode to press the "Push
commit" button often, you feel that you will highly benefit from adding a
keyboard shortcut to push the commits to the remote. So you add the keyboard
shortcut and it feels very ergonomic, within hours/days your mind/nervous system
gets used to the keybinding & you start to take it for granted. When you hop
onto your personal computer after work hours or in the weekend you will badly
miss this keybinding (trust me bro ðŸ˜€)! You now have to manually copy all the
keybindings & settings that you changed in your work computer to your personal
computer typically by pressing buttons on a GUI (Graphical User Interface).

This might sound silly, but I think this small inconvenience of manually syncing
the configurations between multiple computers makes using multiple computers
impractical... You might start feeling that one of your computer is better or
more ergonomic than others (even though it might not be true, its just
"Familarity Bias") and you would end up spending most of your time on this "one"
computer because you feel the most productive in it.

Using multiple computers become very practical when you get the same experience
across your computers with very small effort.

What if you were able to sync your settings & keybinding across computers using
a single (obiviously familiar) command,

```bash
git pull origin main
```

Virtual machines & Docker containers can also be considered "computers", if you
are someone who spends a lot of time in virtual machines or docker containers,
consistent experience (think system settings, installed programs, custom
keybindings, appearance, etc.) across your hosts, virtual machines & containers
could be extremely valuable.

## New computers (also think virtual machines & Docker containers)

Typically, most computer users tend to configure their computers for better
ergonomics or higher productivity - to finish their work faster. Configurations
might range from switching on the Dark theme, installing/uninstalling programs,
modifying/adding keybindings, tweaking performance, changing a program's
appearance, etc.

Letting go of a computer and setting up everything from scratch on a new
computer could be daunting especially for users who would have invested a lot of
time & energy configuring their computer the way they like.

People who work with virtual machines or Docker containers a lot might even
change their "computers" in hours or days! Setting up new "computers" frequently
by clicking buttons in a GUI or by typing/pasting tons of commands in a shell is
not practical. Obiviously, tools like `docker build`, Ansible playbook, etc.
help us solve this problem (we will be discussing tools like these in-depth in
this blog post).

## Version control

We must be able to track what changes we made to our dotfiles, when and for what
purpose... This allows us to revert changes we didn't like, also we would be
able to debug and fix issues confidently without second guessing what worked and
what didn't.

# In a quest for perfection!

The way I manage my computers/dotfiles currently might not be perfect... I am
aware that the tools and techniques that I currently use are not the absolute
best, and there are better alternatives. My current setup works for me, even if
it is imperfect. I am an eternal learner, I will try hard to keep this blog post
updated or rewrite it if required as I explore and adopt new tools and
techniques since this blog post also serves as a README for my publically
maintained [dotfiles](https://github.com/shibisuriya/.dotfiles) repository and
as a personal reference. Feel free to
[share suggestions](https://github.com/shibisuriya/.dotfiles/issues), or let
[me](https://linkedin.com/in/shibisuriya) know if youâ€™d like me to try
something.

# Ingredients

- Git & Github (obiviously!)

- [Nix (the package manager)](https://nixos.org/download)

- [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for testing/iterating your dotfiles)

- [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app) (uses QEMU under the hood) or
  [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) (for testing/iterating your dotfiles)

- [Ansible playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_intro.html)
  (optional, I have replaced it with Nix package manager in my setup)

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (currently using it with nix-darwin to download &
  install some "non-free" software)

# A note to myself

This is a public repo, make sure to not commit and push sensitive information to
it. Make sure to clean up the commit history if you accidentally pushed
sensitive information to the remote.

Treat this blog post as a gentle introduction to some advanced tools & technics
that are available to manage dotfiles.

If you are new to managing dotfiles, treat this blog post as a highlevel
overview of all the mordern tools & technics that are available.

## Setups

As mentioned earlier, this blog also serves as a README.md file for my dotfiles
repo, I use the instructions written below when setting up a new computer. Skip
the steps that are irrelavant for your setup.

### macOS

1. [Install nix for macOS](https://nixos.org/download/), do a multi user
   installation.

2. Clone the dotfiles repo,

```bash
nix-shell -p git --run "git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/shibisuriya/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles"
```

3. Install nix-darwin

```bash
nix run nix-darwin --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' -- switch --flake ~/.dotfiles/nix-darwin#shibi
```

Note: `nix-darwin` in the above command refers to a flake input.

Ones run, we will have access to the `darwin-rebuild` command.

```bash
darwin-rebuild switch --flake ~/.dotfiles/nix-darwin#shibi
```

4. Install 'Apple Command Line Tools (CLT)'

Neovim Mason uses Apple CLT to build some language servers that I use from
source code.

You can skip this step if your setup doesn't depend on CLT.

```bash
xcode-select install
```

CLT is a subset of Xcode, the command above will not install complete Xcode.

Note: This step can't be automated using nix and must be performed manually.

5. Install TPM - Tmux Package Manager,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
```

Note: This step can be automated using nix.

6. Symlink the dotfiles to their target locations using GNU Stow,

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
./stow.zsh # A shell script, uses GNU Stow under the hood.
```

Instead of using GNU stow to symlink the dotfiles to their target locations we
can use ['nix home-manager'](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager),

My setup is weird! I use nix to manage my computer's system settings and
software packages, git to version control my dotfiles and GNU stow to symlink
them their target locations.

I understand that 'nix home manager' can handle this more gracefully, but for
now I am satisfied with Stow.

7. Update the `.gitconfig` file (this step needs to be automated, I am
   performing this step manually for now because I don't want to store my email,
   full name, etc. in the .gitconfig file publically).

8. Manually install non-free software like Chrome, Obsidian, Docker desktop etc.

# Don't stray away from the defaults (advice)

Only use a handful of tools, also we must develop the habit of using a software
product the way the developer of the product intended it to be used & not
customize it too much, memorize the default keybindings (only the essential ones
not all), study the default behaviours and do not try to make things look
"pretty" (rabbit hole that has no end)! Do not waste time

Keep things dead simple.

## Testing my setups

For testing/iterating purposes I don't install my dotfiles on my host computer.
The obivious reason for this is, I already have my dotfiles installed on my
host, I don't want to reinstall it - I want a computer with 'fresh install'!
Also I don't want to put my host into an incomplete state with partially
installed applications, unnecessary files & directories created, etc. (if the
installation process fails for some reason, happens often while making changes
to the dotfiles), obiviously nix allows me to prevent this, nix builds are
'atomic' either they succeeds completely or nothing changes but I prefer to test
my dotfiles files in an isolated environment, either on a computer having a
'fresh install' or in virtual environments.

### Using Docker

I build a Ubuntu based docker image to verify if my dotfiles install flawlessly,
if the docker build fails for some reason then my dotfiles have issues, I can
immediately correct them and rebuild without worrying about my host computer
getting put into incomplete states. This allows me to test and iterate faster, I
don't want a computer with 'fresh install' which take some time to provision!

You can build a Ubuntu based docker image which has most of the programs you
need preinstalled and configured using your dotfiles.

To build the docker image,

```bash
docker build --target prod -t dotfiles .
```

You can then create a container using this image and copy or volume mount
directories/files from your host. This is extremely useful for
tinkering/testing/learning new things without worrying about random programs
modifying your hostâ€™s settings.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v .:/root/directory_1 dotfiles
```

Currently I am using ansible playbook to install and configure the programs that
I need in the Docker container... I am planning to replace ansible with nix...
In any cases, you might want to debug/change the build process...

To create a Ubuntu based docker image that has Ansible and Nix preinstalled,

```bash
docker build --target dev -t dotfiles:dev .
```

Spin up a container based on this image and volume mount/copy your dotfiles into
it.

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v .:/root/.dotfiles dotfiles:dev
```

Run the ansible playbook,

```bash
ansible-playbook /root/.dotfiles/local.yml
```

## Formatting .nix files

Code formatters to format .nix files such as 'alejandra', 'nixfmt', etc. for
Neovim are not supported in Apple Silicon.

.nix files can be formatted using the 'nix fmt' command,

```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles/nix-darwin
nix fmt
```
