Are you someone who copies or moves huge computer files often? For example, you
could be a photographer who moves the captured photos & videos from your camera
to your computer to free up some space on your camera, you could be a devops or
cloud engineer who moves media files, pdf files, machine learning models, etc.
from one storage service to another to save cost, you could be a sys. admin who
backups an employee's computer before factory resetting it, etc. The point is
moving or copying huge computer files is a day to day responsiblity of a typical
"ops" person.

The annoying part about copying/moving huge computer files is the operation
could be easily interrupted. Imagine you are moving 1 TB of photographs & videos
from your digital camera to your computer by connecting them using a cable, the
operation takes some time to complete & it could fail due to multiple reasons,
your computer could have shutdown due to a power outage, the cable could have
moved causing disconnection, etc.

If a copy or move operation fails, to be on the safer side you have to restart
the operation... The move operation is suspended in A failed "move" operation is
super annoying, some of your files are left at the source & the remaining are
moved to the target.

Also the move operation is super annoying if it fails, some of the files &
directories will be left at the source the others would have been moved to the
target.

Because of this reason, I prefer to copy the files or directories to the target
location & them delete the original instead of moving them (cut the paste).
